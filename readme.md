An economy simulation aiming to achieve a similar level of granularity like x4 and Eve online. This is supposed to be a single player experience.

The game has Stations that can produce wares based on recipes. Those recipes have input and output variables. A station must buy all input wares and then sell the output ware on the market. Prices should be dynamic, based on supply and demand. 

# Goals & constraints
- persistent, living world: nothing comes from thin air, everything comes from resources -> intermediates -> end products
- Readable knobs: prices, recipe times, yields, stock thresholds, policy sliders.
